# Maze

Finding the shortest path in a maze using swarm intelligence algorithms.

The script generates a maze of given size with a graphical interface, and finds the shortest path between start and finish using two different swarm intelligence algorithms (ant colony algorithm, river formation dynamics). It displays the solution of the shortest path in an easily-accessible form for the user.

The execution time for both algorithms is measured to gain insight about the performance of different algorithms.
